# Session Summary - 2026-01-19 #1

## Goal
Parser improvements - continue work on the SQL parser.

## Planning
- Review current parser state and identify areas for improvement
- Check existing parser implementation in the codebase
- Identify specific parser features to work on

## Work Completed
- [x] Verified parser bugs already fixed (NULL, NOT, table aliases)
- [x] Updated TODO.md - marked bugs fixed, PRs merged
- [x] Removed obsolete issue files from `issues/`
- [x] Fixed Lexer.lean deprecation warnings:
  - `String.get?` → `String.toList[n]?`
  - `String.mk` → `String.ofList`
  - `String.split` → `String.splitToList`
- [x] Fixed incorrect test expectations in LexerTestsExtended.lean:
  - `testMultipleStatements`: 9 → 7 tokens
  - `testComplexExpression`: 12 → 10 tokens
- [x] Implemented JOIN parsing (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL OUTER):
  - Added FULL keyword to Token.lean
  - Added parseTableRefSimple, tryParseJoinType, parseTableRef functions
  - Refactored parseSelect to use parseTableRef
  - Added 9 comprehensive JOIN tests
