# Session Summary - 2026-01-18 #1

## Goal
Set up GitHub Codespaces with Lean4 dependencies and create Claude Code skills for session management.

## Planning
- Identified missing Lean4 setup steps in `setup_codespaces.sh` (jumped from Step 1 to Step 5)
- Decided to add elan, Lean4 toolchain, and lake build steps
- Planned Claude skills for `/start-session` and `/session-summary` workflows

## Work Completed
- [x] Added Lean4 dependencies to `setup_codespaces.sh`:
  - Step 2: elan installation
  - Step 3: Lean4 toolchain installation
  - Step 4: lake build
  - Verification checks for elan, lean, lake
  - Updated "Next steps" and "Useful commands" sections
- [x] Updated README.md with GitHub Codespaces setup instructions
- [x] Created `/start-session` skill for feature branch workflow
- [x] Created `/session-summary` skill for session documentation
- [x] Created `Summary/` directory for session notes
- [x] Deleted draft `start_session` file from root

## Commits & PRs
- `2cbfb7e` - Add Lean4 dependencies to codespace setup script
- `9b0f589` - Add Claude Code skills for session management

Branch: `setup_codespace` (no PR created yet)

## Reflections

### What went well
- Clear incremental progress through the setup script improvements
- Skills integrate well together (start-session calls session-summary)

### What could be improved
- Skills may need testing to ensure they're recognized by Claude Code
- Could add more skills for common workflows (e.g., `/end-session`, `/create-pr`)

### Potential skills to create
- `/end-session` - Complete reflections, finalize summary, optionally create PR
- `/create-pr` - Create PR from current branch with summary context
- `/lake-test` - Run Lean tests and report results

## Next Steps
- Test the `/start-session` and `/session-summary` skills
- Consider creating a PR for the `setup_codespace` branch
- Add additional skills as patterns emerge
