# Session Summary - 2026-01-19.3

## Goal
Code simplification - Review and simplify the codebase

## Branch
`claude/start-session-BztNp`

## Progress
- [x] Analyzed codebase for simplification opportunities
- [x] Simplified Keyword mapping in Token.lean (88 lines → 21 lines)
- [x] Simplified join type parsing in Parser.lean (extracted helper)
- [x] Reviewed operator lookahead in Lexer.lean (kept as-is, already clear)
- [x] Committed and pushed changes

## Commits
- `9730dab` - Simplify code: reduce keyword mapping duplication and join parsing

## Changes Made
1. **Token.lean**: Replaced 88 lines of duplicate `Keyword.toString`/`Keyword.fromString?` implementations with a single `keywordTable` (21 lines) that serves as the single source of truth
2. **Parser.lean**: Extracted `tryParseOuterJoin` helper to deduplicate LEFT/RIGHT/FULL join parsing logic

## Statistics
- Net reduction: 57 lines (-117 added, +60 removed)

## Reflections
(to be added at end of session)
